# Real Time Bus Tracker
This project is super cool! It actually records where the bus is heading in realtime from MIT to Harvard from route 1. 
 

## Installation:
You can 'git clone' or save the .zip file. Have fun with your coding editor! 

Here is the live version: https://farrahj99.github.io/Real-Time-Bus-Tracker/

## Usage:
In order to create a location tracker, you would have to use mapbox.com or something similar to it and you would need an API access token. 


## Support:
Contact me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/farrah-jean/.

## Roadmap: 
I would say customizing the whole tracker and adding more locations to it.
